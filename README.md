# Healthcare Exploratory Data Analysis
Healthcare is a critical field where data analysis is necessary in understanding patient demographics, medical conditions and the effectiveness of healthcare services. In this EDA project, I explore a synthetic healthcare dataset that mimics real-world data of 10,000 patient records.

The dataset includes various parts of **patient profiles, admission details, medical conditions and healthcare services** providing a comprehensive foundation for analysis.

* _The healthcare data read in as a pandas dataframe._

I utilized Pandas, NummPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn to prepare, visualize and answer questions about the data. 

* **Example question:** _Which medical condition generated the highest average billing among male patients?_
